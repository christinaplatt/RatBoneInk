			Rachel Leah Gallo is an illustration artist living and working in the south eastern suburbs of Philadelphia. Her favorite mediums to work with are India ink, acrylic paint and watercolors.  The subject matter often includes animals, female figures, lightning bolts, eyeballs, skulls, and food all filtered through the unique perspective of an artist who finds humor and light in the daily dismal march through this thing we call life. <br>
		

			Sometimes dark, sometimes humorous, more often than not darkly humorous, her work cannot be ignored. The images display the power, the beauty and the glory in what some may consider "gross" or "distastful". Her art is unmistakably distinct and original, you know when you are looking at a RatboneInk illustration.<br>
			 She graduated Hussian School of Art in design in 2007 where she studied art history and illustration.  She often shows her work in various boutiques, record shops, and galleries in the Philadelphia area and works with local businesses creating logos and t-shirt designs.<br>
			  Accept this opportunity to harness the creative force that is RatBoneInk for you own needs and purposesmmers bike race.<br>
